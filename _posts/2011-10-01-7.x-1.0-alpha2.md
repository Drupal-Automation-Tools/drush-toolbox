Huge refactor of drush server.

Drush server has been renamed feather (from the apache logo), to reinforce
the dependency on apache and disambiguate this project from the efforts
being done in the main drush project to create a php server.

The bigger refactor is a move from running one instance of httpd per
project, to a more typical virtual host setup.  A separate httpd.conf is
still maintained, keeping this setup independent from the host system setup.
Also, the configuration directory moves from the project directory to
.drush-server in the users home directory.
